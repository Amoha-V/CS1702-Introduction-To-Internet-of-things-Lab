# Voice Controlled Home Automation with Arduino and Bluetooth

## Project Overview
This project aims to enable voice-controlled operation of home appliances, increasing accessibility for individuals with disabilities and enhancing convenience and efficiency in daily routines. The system integrates an Arduino Uno, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and a 2-channel relay module to allow voice commands to control various appliances in a home environment.

## Features
- Voice-controlled operation of home appliances (e.g., turning on/off lights)
- Increased accessibility for individuals with disabilities
- Improved convenience and efficiency in daily tasks
- Expandable home automation system

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- 2-Channel Relay Module (5V)
- 2 Holders
- 2 Light Bulbs
- 220V Electrical Wire with a 2-Pin Male Socket
- Sun Board Piece
- Jumper Wires
- Smartphone
- Buzzer

## Arduino Code
The Arduino code provided in the project document handles the following functionalities:
1. Defines the relay pins for controlling the devices (Light1 and Light2).
2. Establishes a software serial communication between the Arduino and the Bluetooth module.
3. Listens for voice commands received via Bluetooth and executes the corresponding actions.
4. Turns on/off the devices (lights) based on the voice commands.

## Impact
- **Accessibility**: Enhances independence for people with disabilities.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces energy waste and utility costs.
- **Convenience**: Simplifies daily tasks with hands-free control.
- **Technological Advancement**: Demonstrates innovative home automation.
- **Educational Value**: Provides learning opportunities in electronics and programming.

## Future Applications
The project can be further expanded and integrated into various domains, such as:
- **Healthcare**: Integration for patient care and monitoring.
- **Smart Cities**: Control of city infrastructure for efficiency.
- **Industrial Automation**: Voice-operated machinery in factories.
- **Elderly Care**: Assistance for seniors in smart homes.
- **Education**: Interactive learning with voice commands.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Remote control of sensors and data collection.
